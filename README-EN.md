<h2 id="english-descrition">About ✏️</h2>
    <h3>I've always been fond of things related to cinema, so my idea was to create something similar and showcase my work with a cinematic design. Therefore, I sought inspiration that linked cinema and technology, and it didn't take long for me to think of streaming services. Based on this concept, my portfolio features a design with red and black tones and smooth animations. Just like on a streaming platform, this style conveys creativity and professionalism, precisely the image I want to convey.<br><br>
    As a web programmer passionate about UI Design, I focus on creating landing pages, i.e., front-end development. Currently, I'm also studying software and API development. Therefore, in my projects, I emphasize the importance of creating an intuitive interface, both to capture the user's attention and to simplify the use of a back-end service.</h3>
